# MCA-CPP-Practicals

Welcome to the repository containing 31 solutions for the C++ programming language practical exercises as part of the MY MCA (Master of Computer Applications) Learning.



# Prerequisites  
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. If not, first need to download.  
like turbo C++, CodeBlocks, VScode, sublimeText etc.


# Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  


```bash   
git clone https://github.com/Bhawna-Vishwakarma/MCA-CPP-Practicals.git
```


2. Compile and run the C++ programs using your preferred compiler (e.g., g++).  


```bash    
g++ program.cpp -o program
./programs
```
